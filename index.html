                    <dt><strong>What is bodybuilding?</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Bodybuilding is the art of developing one's muscular physique.
                        This is done through weight training and specific eating habits.
                        Unlike powerlifting, whose goal is to become as physically strong as
                        possible, bodybuilding's goal is to create muscle mass, not necessarily strength.
